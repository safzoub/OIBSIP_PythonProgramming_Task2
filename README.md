Task 2: Advanced BMI calculator that generates the Body Mass Index

A desktop GUI application built with Python using Tkinter, SQLite, and Matplotlib that allows users to calculate and store their Body Mass Index (BMI) data and visualize historical trends.

Features:

- Simple GUI for entering weight, height, and username
- Real-time BMI calculation
- Stores historical BMI data with timestamps per user using SQLite
- Plots BMI trend over time using Matplotlib
- Error handling for invalid input (e.g., missing name, invalid height)

Prerequisites:

Make sure you have Python 3 installed along with the following libraries:
pip install matplotlib

Running the application:
Script running: python bmi_calculator.py

How It Works:
- The user inputs their weight, height, and username.
- The app calculates the BMI and displays it.
- The data is stored in an SQLite database.
- Clicking "View Graph" shows the user's BMI trend over time.

Libararies:
- Python 3
- Tkinter – GUI interface
- SQLite – Local data storage
- Matplotlib – Data visualization
